## Overview
If I have some more time, then I will add more features into it.
- Optimized code using lighthouse Chrome extension.
- Add pagination in home page tabular form data.
- Add configuration of I18n language library.
- Make website responsive on all devices (such as change font-size according to diff devices).
- Fixed Issue of Sorting ascending/descending order By field and its types (Such as we have 'date' field with 
Date type then it will be sort according).
- I will add Component test cases (till now I am not good on it).
- Configure jobs pipeline on GitHub. So on every 'git push' jobs will check all test-cases and deploy to server.
(till now I am not good on it).
- Add up/down arrow on every selected column header to represent that current data is ascending order or descending order.
